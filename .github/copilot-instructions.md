## Quick orientation

This repository is a Playwright test suite. Tests live under `tests/` and are executed with the Playwright Test runner configured by `playwright.config.js`.

Keep guidance short and concrete: focus on Playwright patterns found here, how to run and debug tests, and common repo conventions. Avoid broad, generic advice unless it references this codebase.

## Key files
- `playwright.config.js` — test runner configuration (testDir: `./tests`, `reporter: 'html'`, projects for `chromium|firefox|webkit`, `trace: 'on-first-retry'`).
- `package.json` — devDependency on `@playwright/test` but no npm scripts defined.
- `tests/*.spec.js` — example tests; note both ESM `import` and CommonJS `require` style appear (see `example.spec.js` and `HomePage.spec.js`).
- `playwright-report/` and `test-results/` — artifacts generated by test runs; inspect `playwright-report/index.html` for the HTML report.

## How to run (concrete commands)
Use the Playwright CLI via npx so local scripts are not required.

```cmd
npx playwright install        # install browsers (run once on new machines)
npx playwright test           # run full test suite (parallel per config)
npx playwright test tests/example.spec.js   # run a single file
npx playwright test -g "practice test"     # run by test title (grep-like)
npx playwright show-report    # open HTML report (or open playwright-report/index.html)
```

Debugging and headed runs:

```cmd
npx playwright test --debug          # open inspector with breakpoints
npx playwright test --headed --project=chromium  # run headed in Chromium
```

CI note: `playwright.config.js` sets `forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI` so any `test.only` will fail in CI. Locally `test.only` is present in `tests/example.spec.js` — remove before pushing if you expect full-suite runs on CI.

## Patterns and conventions in this repo
- Tests are in `tests/` and use `.spec.js` suffix.
- Mix of import styles: some files use `import { test } from '@playwright/test'` while others use `const { test } = require('@playwright/test')`. When adding new files, match the repository's current testing style or keep files self-contained (Node supports both depending on your package config).
- Preferred locator usage: `page.locator(...)`, `page.getByRole(...)`, and chaining (see `tests/example.spec.js` using `page.locator('.card-body')` and `.locator('b').allTextContents()`). Follow the concrete selector examples in that file.
- Tracing is enabled on first retry per config — tests may generate trace artifacts; use Playwright Trace Viewer when investigating retries.

## Common pitfalls / repo specifics
- package.json has no `scripts` — contributors typically run Playwright with `npx playwright ...`.
- Browsers may be missing on fresh machines; run `npx playwright install` before running tests.
- There is a `test.only` in `tests/example.spec.js` — search for `only` globally before CI runs.
- Tests sometimes use `page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')` to wait for SPA navigation; prefer built-in Playwright waitFor* helpers when possible but follow existing tests for consistency.

## Examples to reference when coding
- Login example (`tests/example.spec.js`):
			- fills selectors:

				```text
				#userEmail
				#userPassword
				```

			- clicks: `[value='Login']`
			- reads product titles using locator `.card-body b`
- Page assertions: `tests/HomePage.spec.js` shows idiomatic `await expect(page).toHaveTitle('YouTube')` and `await expect(page).toHaveURL(...)`.

## When editing tests or config
- If changing `playwright.config.js`, keep the reporter as `html` unless you explicitly update CI to consume different output.
- Add npm scripts to `package.json` only if you also update any contributor docs; otherwise prefer `npx playwright` commands in PR descriptions.

## What I cannot infer
- CI pipeline details (where tests run, environment variables, or secrets) are not present in this repo. If you want CI-specific instructions (GitHub Actions, etc.), provide the workflow files or desired behavior and I will adapt the guidance.

---
If you want, I can add small convenience npm scripts to `package.json` (e.g. `test`, `test:debug`, `report`) and/or remove the accidental `test.only` in `tests/example.spec.js`. Which would you prefer next?
